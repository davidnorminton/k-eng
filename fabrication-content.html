<h2>Fabrication</h2>
<p>
<b>The team of highly skilled engineers are devoted to ensuring the very best quality in product manufacture and assembly.</b> 
</p>
We use a wide range of techniques including Mig welding, Tig welding, Pulse Tig Welding, Stud Welding amongst many others. Each of these techniques can be applied to various materials.
</p>
Our 15-tonne crane, which runs the full length of the building, allows a smooth flow of work around the workshop. We can undertake repair work, prototypes, bespoke developments and production runs.
</p>
One of the other aspects of our business is site works.We have mobile equipment for undertaking off-site workings. This enables us to install parts which have been pre-fabricated in our workshop and brought to site for final fitting.
</p>
We have the ability to design and manufacture various components which can be applied to sheet metal parts such as bosses, pipe fittings etc.
