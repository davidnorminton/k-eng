<h2>Folding Press</h2>

<p>


<b>Our Bystronic and Edwards Pearson presses ensure the highest standard of precision folding.</b>
</p>
<p>
The folding operation of sheet metal product is carried out to a very high level of quality engineering.
</p>
<p>  
The two hydraulic press brake machines each have six axes allowing for constant repeatable bending to create a precise and professional result.    With a wide range of tooling, each is capable of folding between 0.5mm and 6mm and handling up to 3 metres in length.
</p>
<p> 
The technology of the press machines includes a CNC graphic interface and a computerised library. 
The library gives easy access to our customer database so that when repeat orders are received we can quickly and efficiently retrieve past details.   This helps us re-create previous work to the same high standard whilst at the same time being able to pass on savings to our customers.  Let our design team give you the freedom to make your ideas become reality.
</p>
<p>
The design team is either at the end of the phone or available for you to visit us to help you discuss your ideas.   Whether it be a roughly sketched idea or fully detailed drawings, we will work through all options to realise your finished product.  The 3D ability of our CAD software, Solidworks, allows us to quickly build an accurate model to help you visualise your finished product for either a one-off or a production run.

Knaresborough Engineering realises a designer can create anything on a screen in a cyber world.  We understand the production parameters of the materials we are using to create your products.  Our design team have many years’ experience on the shop floor which allows us to apply this knowledge, giving greater understanding of the processes involved, from design to manufacture.
Knaresborough Engineering believes communication with its customers is an integral part of the design process.  Equally important is our ability to communicate between the designers and the workshop craftsmen.  After all, it is the workshop team who have the capability to accomplish the designers’ concepts.
