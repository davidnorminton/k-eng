<h2>Laser cutting</h2>

<p>


<b>The AMADA LC-2415 ALPHA III produces a high standard of precision cutting and profiling.</b>
</p>
<p>
The laser offers state-of-the-art technology to meet the highest standards in quality and reliability.
</p>
<p>
The use of one of the world’s leading sheet metal cad cam packages, RADAN, ensures accurate and highly efficient manufacturing throughout all stages of the process.
</p>
<p>
The laser gives the flexibility to produce any profile shape, without the tooling costs incurred with punching, whether a one-off prototype or a full production run.
</p>
<p>
Our stock holding in stainless steel grades 304 and 316, zintec, galvanised and hot rolled mild steel allows a quick turn-around of production and those urgent one-off profiles that are ‘wanted yesterday’.  Material not in stock can usually be sourced from our extensive range of local suppliers with a next day delivery.
</p>
<p>
Our Amada contact head lets us cut coated sheets, allowing the product to retain its protection throughout all production processes with the additional benefits of high speed cutting with Nitrogen which gives an oxide free, clean cut edge.  Also, our auto height sensor head allows us to cut with no surface marking.
